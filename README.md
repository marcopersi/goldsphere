# Getting Started with Goldsphere 

Goldsphere is a web application to order gold products from registered and trusted suppliers, where the individual may choose to have a secure delivery or a custody service included. 

Technically the product is implemented with React. 

In the backlog of the project is an extension using HeroUI for nice(r) themeing. However, this might be done in a separate project.
